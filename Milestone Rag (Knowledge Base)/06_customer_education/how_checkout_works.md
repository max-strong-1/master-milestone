# How Checkout Works

## Summary
Our ordering process is 100% online for convenience.

## Key Details
1.  **Select Material**: Choose the product.
2.  **Enter Zip**: To calculate delivery.
3.  **Read Uses**: Verify it's the right material.
4.  **Select Date/Time**: Schedule delivery.
5.  **Enter Quantity**: How much do you need?
6.  **Checkout**: Pay online.

## When This Applies
- "How do I order?"
- "Can I pay cash to the driver?" (Likely no, emphasizes online ordering).

## How The Agent Should Respond
"It's super easy. You can do it all on our website: pick your material, enter your zip, choose your delivery time, and checkout. It takes just a few minutes."

## Red Flags / Misconceptions
- "100% Online Ordering" implies we prefer not to take credit cards over the phone if possible, or at least that the online path is primary.

## Internal Notes (Not customer-facing)
- "Order 100% Online!"
