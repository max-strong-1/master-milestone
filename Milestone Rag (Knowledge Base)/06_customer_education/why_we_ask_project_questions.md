# Why We Ask Project Questions

## Summary
To ensure the customer gets the *right* material.

## Key Details
- **Expertise**: Customers often guess. We know what works.
- **Avoid Returns**: Returns are costly/impossible for dumped piles.

## How The Agent Should Respond
"I'm asking about your project so I can make sure you get the right stone. I'd hate for you to order something that won't drain properly."
