# Why Zip Code Matters

## Summary
We use "Distance Matrix" technology to calculate delivery fees based on the exact distance from our yard/source to the customer's zip code.

## Key Details
- **Technology**: Distance Matrix Mapping.
- **Benefit**: Saves time & money (fairer than flat rates).
- **Requirement**: Must enter Zip Code to get a price.

## When This Applies
- "Why do you need my zip code before giving me a price?"
- "Can't you just give me a ballpark?"

## How The Agent Should Respond
"We use a special Distance Matrix system to get you the lowest possible delivery fee based on your exact location. I just need your ZIP code to see where our closest truck is."

## Red Flags / Misconceptions
- Customers might think we are harvesting data. Assure them it's just for the quote.

## Internal Notes (Not customer-facing)
- "Fair & Honest Delivery Fees. Using Distance Matrix Not Flat Rate Over Charging".
