# River Gravel

River gravel consists of smooth, rounded stones washed by water. It comes in various sizes.

## Key Details
- **Type**: Round/Smooth stone.
- **Uses**: Decoration, landscaping beds, drainage (if clean).

## When This Applies

- Areas where people walk barefoot (smoother than limestone).

## How The Agent Should Respond
"River gravel gives a nice natural, decorative look. It's smooth and round, unlike the crushed gray limestone."

## Red Flags / Misconceptions
- Round stone does not compact. Do not use for a driveway base (it will roll like marbles).
