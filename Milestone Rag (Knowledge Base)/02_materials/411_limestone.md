## Summary
#411 Gravel is an easy and workable material, similar to #304 but typically with smaller top-size stones. It is used for a compactable base, often as a "finish grade" base.

## Key Details
- **Size**: Mixture of stone and dust (typically smaller max size than #304).
- **Type**: Compactable base material.
- **Workability**: Easy and workable.

## When This Applies
- Building paver patios.
- Retaining wall base.
- Stone walks.
- Fine/finish grade base.

## What The Customer Usually Asks
- "What do I put under my pavers?"
- "I need a smooth base."

## How The Agent Should Respond
"#411 is great for the final layer of your base, like under pavers. It packs down hard but is easier to smooth out than the big #304 chunks."

## Red Flags / Misconceptions
- Like #304, it does not drain well.
- It packs hard.

## Internal Notes (Not customer-facing)
- "Use anywhere that a compactable base material is needed."
