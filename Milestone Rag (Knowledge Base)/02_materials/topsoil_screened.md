# Topsoil (Screened)

## Summary
Screened topsoil is natural soil that has been run through a screen to remove rocks, sticks, and clumps.

## Key Details
- **Type**: Natural soil, pulverized/screened.
- **Uses**: Growing grass, filling low spots, gardens.

## When This Applies
- "I need to plant grass."
- "I need dirt for a flower bed."

## How The Agent Should Respond
"Our screened topsoil is perfect for new lawns or gardens. It's been screened to remove the big rocks and clumps so it's easy to rake out."

## Red Flags / Misconceptions
- "Screened" doesn't mean "Sterile". Weeds can still grow.
- It may still have small pebbles (less than the screen size, e.g., 1/2 inch).
