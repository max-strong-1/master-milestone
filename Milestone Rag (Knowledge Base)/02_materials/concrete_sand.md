# Concrete Sand

## Summary
Concrete sand is a coarse washed sand. It has larger particles than mason sand.

## Key Details
- **Texture**: Coarse, gritty.
- **Uses**: Mixing concrete, base for pavers, bedding for pipes.

## When This Applies
- Paver installations (bedding layer).
- Mixing cement.

## How The Agent Should Respond
"If you're laying pavers, use Concrete Sand for the bedding layer. It allows for better drainage and stability than the fine mason sand."

## Red Flags / Misconceptions
- Not good for sandboxes (too gritty/rough).

## Internal Notes (Not customer-facing)
- Standard ASTM C33 sand.
