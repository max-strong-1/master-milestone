# #57 Limestone / Gravel

## Summary
#57 Gravel is a crushed stone, perfect in size (3/8″ to 1 inch in diameter). It is one of the most popular choices for driveways and drainage.

## Key Details
- **Size**: 3/8″ to 1 inch.
- **Type**: Crushed gravel/limestone.
- **Drainage**: Provides excellent drainage support.

## When This Applies
- Driveway topping (top layer).
- Bike paths.
- Behind retaining walls (for drainage).
- French drains.

## What The Customer Usually Asks
- "What's the standard driveway rock?" (This is it).
- "Will it drain well?" (Yes).

## How The Agent Should Respond
"For a driveway top coat, #57 is the standard. It's about the size of a quarter or nickel, drains well, and locks together enough to drive on."

## Red Flags / Misconceptions
- Don't use for a base (use #304 or #411 for base). #57 doesn't compact well because it lacks "fines" (dust).
- It's "clean" stone, meaning no dust.

## Internal Notes (Not customer-facing)
- Must use behind retaining walls.
