# Pea Gravel

## Summary
Pea Gravel typically refers to small, round, smooth stones (river rock), about the size of a pea (3/8").

## Key Details
- **Size**: ~3/8".
- **Type**: Round / Smooth (River washed).
- **Uses**: Playgrounds, walkways, decorative areas.

## When This Applies
- Customers asking for "round stone" or "playground stone".

## What The Customer Usually Asks
- "Do you have the smooth round rocks?"
- "I want something soft for my kids to walk on."

## How The Agent Should Respond
"We carry #8 Gravel which is a clean small stone. If you specifically need round pea gravel, let me check our current stock, as standard #8 is usually crushed (angular)."

## Red Flags / Misconceptions
- **Crucial Distinction**: Pea gravel is round; #8 Crushed is angular. Round stone rolls (hard to walk on if deep), angular stone locks together.
- Verify if the customer wants "River Gravel" (round) or "Limestone" (crushed).

## Internal Notes (Not customer-facing)
- Check if "River Gravel" or "Pea Gravel" is listed in the specific zip code inventory.
