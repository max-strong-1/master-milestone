# Safety: Slope & Grade Hazards

## Summary
Dumping on a slope is dangerous. The truck can tip over.

## Key Details
- **Level Ground**: Truck must be level side-to-side to dump.
- **Gravity**: As the load lifts, the center of gravity rises.

## When This Applies
- "My driveway is steep."
- "Can you dump on the hill?"

## How The Agent Should Respond
"The truck needs to be on level ground to dump safely. If the spot is too steep, the driver might have to dump at the top or bottom."

## Red Flags / Misconceptions
- Tipping over is a catastrophic risk.
