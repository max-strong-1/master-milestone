# Safety: Soft Ground Hazards

## Summary
Dump trucks are extremely heavy (tens of thousands of pounds). They will sink in soft ground.

## Key Details
- **Risk**: Getting stuck, rutting the yard, damaging underground pipes/septic.
- **Policy**: Curbside delivery is safest if ground is wet.

## When This Applies
- "Drive into my backyard."
- "It rained yesterday."

## How The Agent Should Respond
"If the ground is soft or wet, the truck might sink. The driver will make the final call on safety. Is there a solid spot like the driveway or street?"

## Red Flags / Misconceptions
- "My car drives on it fine." (A car weighs 4k lbs, a loaded dump truck weighs 50k+ lbs).
