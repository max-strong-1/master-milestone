# Safety: Overhead Hazards

## Summary
Dump trucks need vertical clearance to raise their beds.

## Key Details
- **Wires**: Power/Phone lines must be clear.
- **Trees**: Low branches can damage the truck or be damaged.
- **Height**: A raised bed can be 20+ feet high.

## When This Applies
- "Can you dump it under my tree?"
- "I have wires across the driveway."

## How The Agent Should Respond
"The driver needs clear space overhead to raise the bed. Are there any low hanging wires or tree branches where you want it dumped?"

## Red Flags / Misconceptions
- Drivers will not dump if it's unsafe.
