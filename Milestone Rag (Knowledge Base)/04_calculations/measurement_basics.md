# Measurement Basics

## Summary
To accurately calculate material needs, customers must measure their project area in feet and inches. We often need to convert inches to feet for the volume formulas.

## Key Details
- **Inches to Feet Conversion**:
    - 1 Inch = .083 ft
    - 2 Inches = .17 ft
    - 3 Inches = .25 ft
    - 4 Inches = .33 ft
    - 5 Inches = .41 ft
    - 6 Inches = .50 ft
    - 7 Inches = .58 ft
    - 8 Inches = .67 ft
    - 9 Inches = .75 ft
    - 10 Inches = .83 ft
    - 11 Inches = .92 ft
    - 12 Inches = 1.0 ft

## When This Applies
When a customer has measurements in inches (especially for depth) and needs to convert them to feet for the calculator.

## What The Customer Usually Asks
- "My driveway is 4 inches deep, how many feet is that?"
- "Do I measure in yards or feet?" (Answer: Measure in feet, we calculate yards).

## How The Agent Should Respond
"Measure your length and width in feet. For the depth, if it's in inches, we can convert it. For example, 3 inches is 0.25 feet."

## Red Flags / Misconceptions
- Customers often mix up feet and yards.
- Customers forget to convert depth to feet before multiplying (e.g., multiplying 100 ft x 10 ft x 4 inches without converting 4 inches to 0.33 ft).

## Internal Notes (Not customer-facing)
- Always double-check the units the customer is using.
