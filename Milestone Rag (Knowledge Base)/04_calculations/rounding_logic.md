# Rounding Logic

## Summary
Calculations are theoretical. In the real world, it's better to have a little too much than not enough.

## Key Details
- **Estimates Only**: All calculator results are estimates.
- **Round Up**: Always round up to the nearest half or whole yard/ton.
- **Compaction**: Material compacts. What looks like 3 inches loose might pack down to 2 inches.

## When This Applies
When giving a final quote or quantity.

## What The Customer Usually Asks
- "Can I get exactly 4.2 yards?" (We probably sell in 0.5 or 1 increments, or just say "Let's call it 4.5 or 5").
- "What if I have extra?"

## How The Agent Should Respond
"It's always better to have a little extra than to run short and pay for another delivery fee. I'd recommend rounding up to [X]."

## Red Flags / Misconceptions
- Exact measurements in the real world are rare. Ground is uneven.
- "Not responsible for any discrepancies in material based on calculations made with this app."

## Internal Notes (Not customer-facing)
- Safety margin is key.
