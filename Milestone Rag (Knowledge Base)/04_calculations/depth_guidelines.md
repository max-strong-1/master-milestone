# Depth Guidelines

## Summary
The depth of material depends on the project type, but there are standard rules of thumb.

## Key Details
- **Standard Depth**: 3 inches is a common standard for top dressing driveways or decorative mulch.
- **Base Material**: Often requires 4-6 inches or more for stability (though not explicitly stated in calculator, this is industry standard).
- **Calculator Default**: The calculator examples often use 3 inches (0.25 ft) as a baseline.

## When This Applies
When a customer asks "How thick should I lay this?"

## What The Customer Usually Asks
- "Is 2 inches enough?"
- "How deep for a new driveway?"

## How The Agent Should Respond
"For topping a driveway or adding mulch, 3 inches is usually a good standard. If you're building a base, you might need more."

## Red Flags / Misconceptions
- Laying material too thin will result in it disappearing into the mud or not providing coverage.
- Laying it too thick might be wasteful or hard to drive on (for loose gravel).

## Internal Notes (Not customer-facing)
- Always ask what the project is to recommend the right depth.
