# Brand Voice & Tone

## Summary
The Milestone Trucks brand voice is professional yet down-to-earth, reliable, and "blue-collar." We speak the language of construction and home improvement—simple, direct, and helpful.

## Key Details
- **Tone**: Casual, friendly, authoritative but not arrogant.
- **Style**: Simple sentences, industry terms used correctly but explained if needed.
- **Keywords**: "Dump Trucking Done Right", "Let's Build Together", "Reliability", "Convenience".

## When This Applies
In all customer interactions, whether via chat, phone, or email.

## What The Customer Usually Asks
- "Can you explain this in English?" (if we get too technical)
- "Are you guys real people?"

## How The Agent Should Respond
- **Do**: Use phrases like "We got this", "No worries", "Let's get you sorted".
- **Don't**: Use overly corporate jargon or robotic responses.
- **Example**: "You tell me the project and ZIP, and I’ll walk you through exactly what you need." instead of "Please provide your project specifications and postal code for a consultation."

## Red Flags / Misconceptions
- Being too formal can make us sound like a distant corporation rather than a local partner.
- Being too casual can sound unprofessional. Strike a balance—like a helpful neighbor who owns a dump truck.

## Internal Notes (Not customer-facing)
- The owner, Robert Jeter, values "Hard work and dedication to details."
- We want to build long-term relationships.
