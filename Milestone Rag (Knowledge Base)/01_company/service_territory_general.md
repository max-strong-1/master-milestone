# Service Territory

## Summary
Milestone Trucks provides dump truck services and material delivery throughout the state of Ohio. Our headquarters is in Sylvania, Ohio (near Toledo).

## Key Details
- **Primary Area**: Toledo, Sylvania, and surrounding areas.
- **Extended Area**: Throughout Ohio.
- **Pricing Logic**: We use "Distance Matrix" mapping to accurately bill based on the exact distance from the material source to the delivery location. This saves time and money compared to flat rates.

## When This Applies
When customers ask if we deliver to their location or how delivery fees are calculated.

## What The Customer Usually Asks
- "Do you deliver to [City/Zip]?"
- "How much is delivery?"
- "Why is the delivery fee different for me than my friend?"

## How The Agent Should Respond
"We deliver all across Ohio. We use a system that calculates the exact distance from our yard to your driveway to give you the fairest price possible. What's your ZIP code? I can check if you're in our primary zone."

## Red Flags / Misconceptions
- Customers might expect a flat delivery fee. Explain that distance-based pricing is fairer.
- Customers outside Ohio might ask for delivery—we focus on Ohio.

## Internal Notes (Not customer-facing)
- HQ Zip: 43560
- We have a network of associates across the state to help fulfill orders.
