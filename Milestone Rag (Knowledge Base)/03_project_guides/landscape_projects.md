# Project Guide: Landscape Projects

## Summary
Landscaping involves decorative ground cover and soil for plants.

## Key Details
- **Ground Cover**: **Mulch** (Brown, Black, Red) or **River Gravel** (Decorative Stone).
- **Planting**: **Screened Topsoil**.
- **Walkways**: **#8 Gravel** or **Pea Gravel**.

## When This Applies
- "I'm sprucing up my flower beds."
- "I need dirt for a garden."

## How The Agent Should Respond
"We have dyed mulch in brown, black, or red for a fresh look. Or if you want stone, river gravel looks great. For the plants themselves, our screened topsoil is ready to go."

## Red Flags / Misconceptions
- Don't use Fill Dirt for gardens (it has no nutrients).
