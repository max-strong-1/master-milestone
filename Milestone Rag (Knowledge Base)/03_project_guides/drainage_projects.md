# Project Guide: Drainage Projects

## Summary
Drainage projects require clean stone that allows water to flow through gaps.

## Key Details
- **French Drains**: Use **#57 Limestone** (washed/clean).
- **Heavy Flow/Ditches**: Use **#1 or #2 Stone** (large) or **Riprap**.
- **Pipe Bedding**: Use **#57** or **#8 Gravel**.

## When This Applies
- "I have standing water in my yard."
- "I'm installing a French drain."

## How The Agent Should Respond
"For drainage, you need clean stone without dust. #57 limestone is the standard for French drains. If you have a big ditch with fast water, you might need the larger #1 or #2 stone."

## Red Flags / Misconceptions
- Never use "Base" material (#304/#411) for drainage—the dust will clog the pipes.
