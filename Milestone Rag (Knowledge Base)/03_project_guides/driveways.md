# Project Guide: Driveways

## Summary
Building or refreshing a driveway requires the right layers. A solid base is key.

## Key Details
- **Base Layer**: Use **#304 Limestone** or **#411 Limestone**. These pack down hard to create a solid foundation.
- **Top Layer**: Use **#57 Limestone**. This provides a clean, drainable surface that doesn't track mud.
- **Depth**: Typically 3-4 inches for topping; 6+ inches for base (if starting from scratch).

## When This Applies
- "I need gravel for my driveway."
- "My driveway is a mud pit."

## How The Agent Should Respond
"If you're just topping it off, #57 stone is perfect. If you're building it from scratch or fixing deep mud, you'll need a base of #304 first."

## Red Flags / Misconceptions
- Don't use #304 for the top layer unless you don't mind dust/mud tracking.
- Don't use round stone (river gravel) for a driveway—it will roll.
