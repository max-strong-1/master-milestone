# Project Guide: Sheds & Pads

## Summary
Foundations for sheds or hot tubs need to be level and stable.

## Key Details
- **Material**: **#411 Limestone** (packs hard/level) or **#8 Gravel** (for drainage under a raised floor).
- **Leveling**: #411 is easiest to screed level.

## When This Applies
- "I'm putting in a Tuff Shed."
- "I need a base for a hot tub."

## How The Agent Should Respond
"For a shed base, #411 limestone is great because you can pack it down smooth and level. If the shed is raised on blocks, you might want #57 or #8 for drainage underneath."

## Red Flags / Misconceptions
- Ensure the ground is level before adding stone.
