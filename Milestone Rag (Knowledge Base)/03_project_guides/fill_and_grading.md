# Project Guide: Fill & Grading

## Summary
Raising the grade of a yard or filling holes.

## Key Details
- **Deep Fill**: **Fill Dirt** (cheap, packs well).
- **Final Grade**: **Screened Topsoil** (top 2-4 inches) for grass.

## When This Applies
- "My yard slopes too much."
- "I have a low spot that holds water."

## How The Agent Should Respond
"If it's a deep low spot, fill most of it with Fill Dirt to save money, then cap it with Screened Topsoil so you can grow grass."

## Red Flags / Misconceptions
- Don't use topsoil for deep fill (it settles too much and is expensive).
