# Project Guide: Parking Pads

## Summary
Parking pads need to support heavy vehicles, similar to driveways but often for static loads.

## Key Details
- **Material**: **#304** or **#411** for the base is critical.
- **Top**: **#57** for drainage and cleanliness.
- **Depth**: Ensure at least 6-8 inches of base if parking heavy equipment (RVs, boats).

## When This Applies
- "I need a spot to park my RV."
- "I'm making a parking area."

## How The Agent Should Respond
"Since it's for parking, you want a solid base so the vehicle doesn't sink. Start with #304 limestone, then top it with #57."

## Red Flags / Misconceptions
- Parking on soft ground/grass will lead to sinking.
