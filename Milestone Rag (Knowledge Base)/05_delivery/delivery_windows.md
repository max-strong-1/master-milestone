# Delivery Windows

## Summary
We offer scheduled delivery slots. Customers can select their preferred date and time during checkout.

## Key Details
- **Scheduling**: Select date and time online.
- **Multiple Loads**: "Just pick the first load delivery date and time. We will handle the rest and contact you to set up a delivery schedule for multi loads."

## When This Applies
- "When will my truck arrive?"
- "Can I get it on Saturday?"

## How The Agent Should Respond
"You can choose your preferred delivery date and time right on the checkout page. If you need multiple truckloads, just schedule the first one, and we'll coordinate the rest with you."

## Red Flags / Misconceptions
- Exact minute arrival is hard to guarantee due to traffic/loading, but we aim for the scheduled window.

## Internal Notes (Not customer-facing)
- Punctual delivery is a key goal.
