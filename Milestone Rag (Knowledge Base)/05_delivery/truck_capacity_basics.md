# Truck Capacity Basics

## Summary
Our dump trucks typically hold up to 20 cubic yards of material, depending on weight.

## Key Details
- **Standard Capacity**: ~20 Cubic Yards (for lighter materials like mulch/topsoil).
- **Weight Limits**: Heavy stone/gravel might be limited by weight (tons) rather than volume.

## When This Applies
- "How much can one truck hold?"
- "Will I need two trucks?"

## How The Agent Should Respond
"Our trucks can haul up to about 20 yards, but for heavy stone, it might be less due to weight limits. The calculator will help figure out how many loads you need."

## Red Flags / Misconceptions
- 20 yards of Mulch is very different from 20 yards of Gravel (weight-wise).

## Internal Notes (Not customer-facing)
- Calculator example used "20 cubic yard capacity per truck".
