# Driveway Damage Policy

## Summary
Heavy trucks can crack concrete or asphalt.

## Key Details
- **Waiver**: Customer accepts risk by ordering delivery.
- **Prevention**: Dump at the end of the driveway if concerned.

## How The Agent Should Respond
"Just a heads up, our trucks are very heavy. While we're careful, there's always a risk of cracking a driveway, especially if it's thin. If you're worried, we can dump at the street."
