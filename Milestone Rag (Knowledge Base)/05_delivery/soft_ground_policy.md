# Soft Ground Policy

## Summary
We avoid driving on soft ground to prevent damage and getting stuck.

## Key Details
- **Tow Fees**: If a truck gets stuck off-road, the customer pays the tow bill.
- **Curbside**: Default safe option.

## How The Agent Should Respond
"If you want us to drive off the driveway, just know that if the truck gets stuck, you'd be responsible for the tow. We recommend curbside dumping if it's been raining."
