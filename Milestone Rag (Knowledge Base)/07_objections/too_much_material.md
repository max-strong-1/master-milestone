# Objection: Too Much Material

## Summary
Customer worries about ordering too much.

## Key Details
- **Better Safe**: Cheaper to have extra than pay for a second truck.
- **Uses**: Extra stone can be used for potholes; extra mulch for trees.

## How The Agent Should Respond
"It's always better to have a little extra than to run short. If you're short, you have to pay for another whole delivery fee. If you have extra, you can always find a use for it."
