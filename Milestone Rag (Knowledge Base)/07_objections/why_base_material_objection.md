# Objection: Why Base Material?

## Summary
Customer wants to skip the base layer to save money.

## Key Details
- **Longevity**: Without base, the driveway will sink/fail.
- **Investment**: Do it right once.

## How The Agent Should Respond
"You can skip the base, but your new gravel will just sink into the mud in a few months. Putting down a base of #304 ensures it lasts for years."
